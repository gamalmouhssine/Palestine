# Palestine
This code uses the matplotlib library to create a representation of the flag of Palestine. 
It draws three horizontal stripes (black, white, and green) and a red triangle on the hoist side. 
You can adjust the size and proportions as needed. To run this code, you'll need to have matplotlib installed in your Python environment.
You can install it using pip:
pip install matplotlib
